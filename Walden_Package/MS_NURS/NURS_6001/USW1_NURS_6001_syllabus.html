              <h3 id="primary-secondary-sources">Primary and Secondary Sources</h3>
              <p>Review the following information prior to selecting resources for assignments.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Primary:</em></strong> A primary source is an original document that is the first account of what happened. A research report is primary, and you can tell because it includes materials and methods demonstrating how the research was done. Some creative work is also primary, such as poetry, novels, and interviews of people who experienced something firsthand. In nursing, which is an evidence-based discipline, we strive to use primary research that is published in scholarly, peer-reviewed journals.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Scholarly, peer-reviewed journal:</em></strong> Scholarly journals publish papers by professional authors and experts in the field using a peer-review process to review the work and assure quality before publishing. The focus of a scholarly journal is to provide accurate information for scholars and other researchers. The focus is on content rather than advertising, a direct contrast to popular media. Scholarly journals publish both primary and secondary papers, the former usually noted as original research and the latter as reviews and commentaries. Letters to the editor may also be published but should be recognized as opinion pieces.</p>
              <blockquote class="note"><p><strong>Note:</strong> When selecting articles for course assignments, you are advised (unless you are referencing seminal information) to focus on work published within the past five years.</p></blockquote>
              
              <p><strong><em>Secondary:</em></strong> A secondary source is one step removed from the original source. This work interprets and often compiles other work, and it includes review articles, textbooks, fact sheets, and commentaries about a topic. It also includes news reports of original research. Secondary work is more prone to error and bias than primary work because it is being filtered through an additional person or persons. Review papers can be useful to glean information about a topic and to find other sources from the reference list, but it is the original, primary research that should be relied on most heavily in demonstrating scholarship, depth, and validation of factual information.</p>
              <h3 id="course-assignments">Course Assignments</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Participation in weekly Discussions: </strong>The exchange of ideas among colleagues engaged in scholarly inquiry is a key aspect of learning and is a requisite activity in this course. You are expected to participate each week by posting a response to a prompt or question in the weekly Discussion area. In addition, you are expected to respond to your fellow students&rsquo; postings. To count as participation, responses need to be thoughtful; that is, they must refer to the week&rsquo;s readings, relevant issues in the news, information obtained from other sources, and/or ideas expressed in the postings of other class members. You may ask questions or offer further information or links about the subject. Please pay attention to grammar and spelling, as consistently poorly written posts will receive grade penalties. In grading the required Discussion postings, your Instructor will be using the Discussion Posting and Response Rubric, located in the <strong>Course Information </strong>area.</li></ol>
                  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Unless otherwise noted, initial postings to Discussions are due on or before <strong>Day 3</strong>, and response postings are due on or before <strong>Day 6</strong>. <strong>You are required to participate in the Discussion on at least three different days (a different day for main post and each response).</strong> It is important to adhere to the weekly time frame to allow others ample time to respond to your posting. In addition, you are expected to respond to questions directed toward your own initial posting in a timely manner.</p></blockquote><br />
                <ol start="2"><li><strong>Assignments: </strong>The Assignments provide you with the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge gained through the Learning Resources and the practicum experience. See the Assignment area of specific weeks for detailed descriptions of the assignments. In grading the required Assignments, your Instructor will be using rubrics located in the <strong>Course Information</strong> area.</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio Assignment:</strong> Each course in the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program includes a Portfolio Assignment. The Portfolio Assignment is designed to measure specific professional knowledge and skills as outlined in the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Master&rsquo;s Essentials. Students submit the Portfolio Assignment in the online classroom and a criterion-based scoring rubric is used to grade the assignment. The rubric is aligned with American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Master&rsquo;s Essentials and provides specific and informative feedback on your performance. The Portfolio Assignment is evaluated by the course Instructor.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="grading-criteria">Grading Criteria and Total Components of a Grade</h3>
              <p>At the end of NURS 6001: Foundations of Graduate Study, you will earn either a <strong>Satisfactory (S)</strong> or<strong>Unsatisfactory (U)</strong> grade based on the <u>weighted total percent</u> earned in the course.  </p>
              <p>The course quiz, discussions, and written assignment each have a particular percentage of weight (see breakdown below).  A grade of <strong>Satisfactory (S)</strong> will be earned if the weighted total percent is 80% or above.  A grade of <strong>Unsatisfactory (U)</strong> will be earned if the weighted total percent is less than (&lt;) 80%.</p>
              <p>For example, there are 5 discussions in this course that you need to participate in.  Each discussion is worth 100 points for an overall total of 500 (100 points x 5 discussions) points.  If your 5 discussions earned a total of 450 points, a weighted percent of 0.63 (450/500 x .70 = 0.63) is given for discussions.
              </p>

              <h3 id="incomplete-grade-policy">Incomplete Grade Policy</h3>
              <p>Per University policy, Incomplete grades can be granted only to students who have already met the minimum criteria for active weekly participation in a course (including weekly postings in online courses) and have completed at least 80% of other coursework. Incompletes can be awarded when, because of extenuating circumstances, a student has not met additional course requirements, including but not limited to written assignments, group projects, and research papers, as applicable. All Incomplete grades are awarded at the discretion of the course faculty. (Reproduced from Student Catalog)</p>
              <p>Students who are eligible for an Incomplete must contact the Course Faculty to request the grade as soon as possible. Students who do not meet the criteria listed above will not be allowed to earn an Incomplete. If the Incomplete is approved, the Faculty Member will work with the student to outline the due date(s) for remaining work. Under no circumstances will the new due dates extend beyond 50 days from the last day of the term. Faculty will then have 10 days to assess the work and post the permanent grade before the University-allotted Incomplete time limit of 60 days expires. All Incomplete grades not resolved within the time allotted will convert to permanent grades of F.</p>
              <h3 id="instructor-feedback-schedule">Instructor Feedback Schedule</h3>
              <p>The Instructor will log in to the course during the week to monitor the weekly Discussion area. Feedback will be provided via the My Grades area, the Discussion area, and/or the Announcements page.</p>
              <p>You can expect your weekly assignment grades to be posted within 10 calendar days of a due date. Instructor feedback and explanation is provided whenever full credit is not achieved. Depending on the nature of the feedback, Instructor responses may be posted to the Discussion area or included in the My Grades area. The goal of your Instructor is to act as a discussion and learning facilitator rather than a lecturer. The Instructor will not respond to every posting by every individual, so please feel free to ask your Instructor if you would like some personal feedback on a particular assignment posting or any time you have any questions regarding your assignments or your grade.</p>
              <h3 id="course-procedures">Course Procedures</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>All class Discussions take place in the weekly Discussion areas.</li>
                <li>You are encouraged to post course-related questions to the <strong>Contact the Instructor</strong> area as they may be of interest to all; however, if your question is urgent, it is often best to e-mail the Instructor. If your e-mailed question is thought to be of benefit to all, it may be responded to by the Instructor via e-mail to all or posted as an announcement.</li>
                <li>Instructor feedback on content and writing issues that is thought to be of benefit to the entire class may be posted to the<strong> Contact the Instructor</strong> area; however, most personal critique will be done privately in the Grade Center. Be sure to check the Grade Center for comments every week even if you received full credit.</li>
                <li>Please feel free to use the Class Café to initiate and participate in conversations not directly related to the course. This is an excellent opportunity to get to know other students better. The Instructor will browse the Class Café occasionally but generally will not respond to conversations posted there unless students have specific questions for him or her.</li>
                <li>Check the e-mail account you use for official Walden University business on a regular basis. The expectation is that you are checking this e-mail account daily during the week. If you experience difficulty sending or receiving Walden e-mail, please contact the Student Support Team right away. Contact information for the Student Support Team is located in the Student Support area.</li>
                <li>Review all materials in the Course Information area, as well as the materials contained under each of the weekly buttons. </li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote class="note"><p><strong>Note:</strong> There are Optional Readings located within the Learning Resources section of each week in the course. You are encouraged to explore these readings, as needed, in order to enhance your understanding of the course content.</p></blockquote>
              <h3 id="delivering-assignments">Preferred Methods for Delivering Assignments</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Be sure that you post to the correct Discussion area each week. Do not e-mail postings to the Instructor. For all initial Discussion postings, make sure that the first sentence of your posting reads<strong> Main Question Post</strong>. For your responses to others&rsquo; response postings, make sure that the first sentence of your response reads <strong>Response</strong>. These actions will ensure easily identifiable subject lines for your postings and responses.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Application Assignments are submitted to the <strong>SafeAssign</strong> link and named according to the week in which the Assignment is submitted. Directions for naming each Application Assignment are included in each week&rsquo;s Assignment area. Please be sure that all written Application Assignments are saved and submitted as a &ldquo;.doc&rdquo; file.</li>
                <li>All e-mail correspondence must contain in the subject line &ldquo;NURS 6001-XX-NAME&rdquo; (XX is the section number) followed by a brief description of the subject. This subject line convention ensures that your e-mail will be easily identified and responded to in a timely manner. It is required that the e-mail contain a signature that matches the official name used in the course.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="late-assignment-policy">Late Assignment Policy</h3>
              <p>Students are expected to submit assignments by the due dates noted in the course. In extenuating circumstances, such as illness, the student must contact the Instructor as soon as possible to discuss the situation. In those circumstances, faculty will determine the appropriate course of action for the student. Depending on the situation, these actions may include recommendations to drop the course (if within the University drop/withdrawal period), acceptance of some or all of the overdue assignments with or without penalties, or failure to accept assignments.</p>
              <p>Assignments submitted late without prior agreement of the Instructor, outside of an emergency absence, or in violation of agreements for late submission, will receive a grade reduction for the assignment amounting up to 20%. After 5 days, the assignment will not be graded. Students should be aware that late assignments may not receive the same level of written feedback as do assignments submitted on time.</p>
              <h3 id="keeping-your-coursework">Keeping Your Coursework</h3>
              <p>You will have access to the course and your coursework from the course start date until 60 days after the course ends. After this time, you will no longer be able to access the course or related materials. <strong>For this reason, we strongly recommend that you retain copies of your completed assignments and any documents you wish to keep.</strong> The University is not responsible for lost or missing coursework.</p>
              <h3 id="course-evaluation">Course Evaluation</h3>
              <p>At or near the end of the course, you will receive an e-mail inviting you to submit an online evaluation of the course and instruction. All submitted course evaluations are confidential, and only aggregate data and comments will be shared with the Instructor and Program Director. Your feedback is vitally important to Walden University in its efforts to continuously improve programs.</p>
              <h3 id="students-with-disabilities">Students With Disabilities</h3>
              <p>Students in this course who have a disability that might prevent them  from fully demonstrating their abilities should contact the director of  disability services at <a href="mailto:disability@waldenu.edu" title="disability@waldenu.edu">disability@waldenu.edu</a> or at 1-800-925-3368, ext. 312-1205 and +1-612-925-3368 or <a href="https://www.waldenu.edu/contact" target="_blank" title="Contact">https://www.waldenu.edu/contact</a> for international toll-free numbers as soon as possible to initiate disability verification and discuss accommodations that may be necessary to ensure full participation in the successful completion of course requirements.</p>
              <h3 id="classroom-participation">Classroom Participation</h3>
              <p>In accordance with  U.S. Department of Education guidance regarding class participation, Walden  University requires that all students submit at least one of their required  Week 1 assignments (which includes posting to the Discussion Board) within each  course(s) during the first 7 calendar days of class. For courses with two-week  units, posting to the Discussion Board by Day 7 meets this requirement. The  first calendar day of class is the official start date of the course as posted  on your myWalden academic page. </p>
              <p><strong>Assignments  submitted prior to the official start date <em>will not</em> count toward your  participation. </strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Financial Aid  cannot be released without class participation as defined above. </strong> </p>
              <p>Students who <strong>are  taking their first class with Walden</strong> and do not submit at least one of  their required Week 1 assignments (or at least one Discussion post) by the end  of the 7th day will be administratively withdrawn from the university. </p>
              <p>Students who have  already taken and successfully completed <strong>at least one</strong> or more class(es)  with Walden, and who <strong>do not participate</strong> within the first 7 days, will be  dropped from that class. </p>
              <p>If you have any  questions about your assignments, or you are unable to complete your  assignments, please contact your Faculty Member.</p>
